This folder contains all the work for my Data Structures and Algorithms class, which I took in my second semester of freshman year. I learned about how to create and identify the efficiencies of different data structures as well as how to sort and traverse them.

Each folder within the main folder contains a homework and a lab. The lab is the guided practice to build the algorithm/data structure that we learned from the lecture and the homework makes us implement the algorithm/data structure using a real-world example problem.
